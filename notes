** Part 1 **
    1. Read csv into a DataFrame

    2. Remove "MYOPIC" column from the dataset 
        - This will be the target column before

    3. Standardize your dataset so the columns that contain larger values do not influence the outcome more than columns with smaller values

** Part 2 **
    1. Perform dimensionality reduction with PCA 
        - How did the number of the features change?
        - State the desired explained variance
            - If data has 100 features, using {PCA(n_components=0.99)} creates
            a model that will preserve approx. 99% of the explained variance
            - Whether it means reducing the datset to 80 principal components or 3
            - Preserve about 90% of the explained variance in D.R

    2, Further the dataset dimensions with t-SNE && visually inspect the results
        - Do this by, running t-SNE on the principal components, which is the output of the PCA transformations

    3. Create a scatter plot of the t-SNE output
        - Are there distinct clusters?

** Part 3 **
    1. Create an elbow plot to identify the best number of clusters:
        - Use a {for loop} to determine the inertia for each {K} between 1 through 10
        - If possible, determine where the elbow of the plot is, and at which value of K it appears

** Part 4 **
    1. Based on your findings, write a bried (1 or 2 sentence) recommendation for your supervisor in your notebook
        - Can the patients be clustered?, If so, how many clusters?
